# Comparing Human versus Algorithm Interpretation by Topic Detection in Academic Surveys

## Description

Folders of the files used for the analysis and implemetation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation and K-means clustering on academic surveys for my masters thesis.

## Folder Structure

- `kmeans_results`: csv files output by the k-means clusteering algorithm. Each file contains the results of one survey.
- `lda_results`: csv files output by the lda algorithm. Each file contains the results of one survey.
- `notebook_files`: Files used for the creation of the csv files. The files with `_single_file` shows the performance of lda and kmeans on one survey. The files with `_program` show the performance of lda and kmeans on all of the surveys. The `doc_analysis` file shows my analysis prior to preprocessing.
- `survey_text_files`: contains the files of all of the survey questions in a text file.

## Note

To run this implementation of kmeans and lda, the text files must be in the same directory as the jupyter notebook files.

This is a masters thesis project performed by me, Brittany Steenbergen.
